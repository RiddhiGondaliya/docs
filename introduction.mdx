title: "About Me"
description: "Hi, I’m Riddhi! I’m a Silicon Valley-based Product Designer working on AR/VR experiences. I’ve worked at a B2C startup in AI/ML and in the AR/VR Research Lab at Arizona State University. Currently, I’m expanding my skills in SAAS and B2B products. I enjoy watching movies, attending conferences, meeting new people, and participating in hackathons. I’m always eager to learn about new technologies where I can contribute my design skills. Staying active in the community is something I love!"
